# Knitted Blanket 🧶

Jess has got into knitting recently and is making a chequered blanket so I found this Three.js
cloth simulation and gave it a grid texture to help her decide what colours to use.

> Cannon-es' cloth sim which I used: https://github.com/pmndrs/cannon-es/blob/c72307cae66757e49b7f8471c16c1e1842789479/examples/threejs_cloth.html

## How to run
- Install dependencies: `pnpm install`.
- Serve the project: `pnpm vite`.
